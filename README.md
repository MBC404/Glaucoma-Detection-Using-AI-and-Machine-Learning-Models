# Glaucoma Detection Using AI and Machine Learning Models

This project focuses on building an AI-driven system to detect **Glaucoma**, a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. The goal is to leverage **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)** models to analyze ophthalmic data (such as fundus images and visual field tests) for early and accurate glaucoma detection.

## Key Objectives
- Automate the detection of glaucoma using AI-based models.
- Improve diagnostic accuracy compared to traditional methods.
- Provide an assistive tool for ophthalmologists to support clinical decision-making.

## Features
- Preprocessing of ophthalmic datasets (fundus images, VF values, etc.).
- Training and evaluation of ML/DL models for glaucoma classification.
- Performance comparison between different algorithms.
- Scalable pipeline for medical research and real-world applications.

## Future Work
- Add detailed dataset description and preprocessing pipeline.
- Integrate explainable AI methods to highlight decision regions in images.
- Deploy the trained model as a web or desktop application for clinical use.
